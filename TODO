- Some sort of trait-like support possibly as an extensibility hook

	class Foo :Dirty {
		# no namespace::sweep
	}
	
	class Bar :Mutable {
		# no __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable
	}
	
Simplest mechanism seems to be, when `:XXX` is encountered, we compose
the role Moops::Trait::XXX to the code generator.

- An assertion mechanism for use within methods/functions.

	assert { ... };

Normally, this keyword would be rewritten to:

	if (0) { ... };    # should be optimized away

Under EXTENDED_TESTING/AUTHOR_TESTING/RELEASE_TESTING/AUTOMATED_TESTING,
it would be rewritten to:

	die "Assertion failed" unless do { ... };
